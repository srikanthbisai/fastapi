Fastapi Backend deployed on Render. 
The render server turns down when not in use so have set up a cron job every 6 minutes it might take a while to start the server.
It will start when we hit the request from the frontend or if bychance the cron job has activated the server just before the request. 
Will deploy the backend on AWS shortly.
